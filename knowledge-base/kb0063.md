<h2>Note for Keyman Desktop 9</h2>
<p>These instructions were written for Keyman Desktop 7. Keyman Desktop 9 makes this process simpler; details can be found in the <a href='http://help.keyman.com/products/desktop/9.0/docs/start_configure_computer.php'>Keyman Desktop 9 documentation on keyboard configuration</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Associate?</h2>
<p>To improve keyboard layout performance, you can associate your <span style='color:maroon'><b>Keyman keyboard layout</b></span> with a <span style='color:darkgreen'><b>Windows language</b></span> and <span style='color:navy'><b>Windows keyboard layout</b></span>. This has three main benefits.</p>
<p>First, when a <span style='color:maroon'><b>Keyman layout</b></span> and <span style='color:darkgreen'><b>Windows language</b></span> are fully associated, activating one will activate the other. You will no longer need to adjust both every time you wish to use a language.</p>
<p>Second, when the right <span style='color:navy'><b>Windows layout</b></span> and <span style='color:maroon'><b>Keyman layout</b></span> are associated, you can be sure you are using a Keyman layout as it was designed. This is especially helpful if you are using a non-English hardware keyboard as your base Windows layout. For example, if you are using a Spanish, French, or German hardware keyboard.</p> 
<p>Third, assocating a <span style='color:darkgreen'><b>Windows language</b></span> with a <span style='color:maroon'><b>Keyman layout</b></span> lets Windows know which language you are using. This is helpful for a number of reasons: 
<ul>
<li>When using right-to-left languages, the selected Windows language determines the direction of the text. You should always associate a right-to-left Windows language with a Keyman keyboard layout that requires right-to-left support.</li>
<li>Some applications use the selected Windows language to determine how text should be displayed. You may find this to be particularly the case for some Indian languages.</li>
<li>Many applications use the selected Windows language to determine which spell checking or other language tools should be applied to a text. Associating the correct Windows language with you Keyman keyboard layout will ensure that the correct language tools are used on the text.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The good news is that most Keyman keyboard layouts are now designed to automatically configure associations with a Windows language and layout. This means, in many cases, you should not need to configure or associate anything. When you do need to associate Keyman keyboards for best performance, follow the steps below.
