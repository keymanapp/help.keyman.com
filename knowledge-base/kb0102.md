# HOWTO: Installation of IBus and Keyman on Arch Linux and derivatives

## Prerequisites
The instructions below are appropriate for ArchLinux, running KDE Plasma,
Wayland, and sddm. 

## Installation steps

### Upgrade the system
Any OS based on Arch Linux needs a regular full upgrade because of rolling release
concept. 

```bash
sudo pacman -Syyu
```

### Install yay
Build and install a package manager to build and install packages from the
ArchLinux User Repository (AUR). Keyman is provided by AUR. It possible to use
other package managers than `yay` (like `pamac`). 

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git
cd ~
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

### Install Keyman
```bash
sudo pacman -Sy webkit2gtk-4.1 python-setuptools
yay -Sy keyman
```

For further settings and configurations follow the steps 2 to 4 in the 
[HOWTO: Using Keyman for Linux with KDE](kb0101#step-2-provide-the-environment-variables-required-for-the-ibus-input-method-framework).
