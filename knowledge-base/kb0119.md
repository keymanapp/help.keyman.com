# Keyman for Windows version stays the same after upgrade

## Summary

In some cases, when upgrading Keyman for Windows 18 to a newer point release, the software may remain on the same version after the update process.

This happens because the installer for the currently installed version is still cached on the local machine. When the update process starts, the cached installer is used instead of the newly downloaded version, so the upgrade does not complete as expected.

## Manual update to the latest version

To resolve this issue, install the latest version manually. You do not need to uninstall the current version before installing the new version.

1. Go to [https://keyman.com/windows/download#standalone](https://keyman.com/windows/download#standalone)
 and download the latest release of Keyman for Windows.

2. Once the download is complete, run the installer directly from your browserâ€™s downloads list or by double-clicking the file in Windows Explorer.

3. After installation, verify that Keyman for Windows shows the updated version number.
