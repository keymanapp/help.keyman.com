# HOWTO: Installing KMComp Command Line Compiler on MacOS Catalina

KMComp is the command line compiler included in Keyman Developer. It is a windows application that can run with [wine](https://www.winehq.org/) on MacOS and Linux

## Installing wine


If you do not have `wine` already installed, install `wine` using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
$ brew cask install xquartz
$ brew cask install wine-stable
```

## Installing KMComp

Refer to the [KMComp Command Line Compiler documentation](https://help.keyman.com/developer/13.0/context/kmcomp?fbclid=IwAR3lbDSPATZ_E5U3q5lpeiIK3-oVE2ulImiK8vIBDX9kG6h2bPoCjycNluQ) for information on how to use KMComp.

MacOS Catalina only supports 64-bit applications, so it is neceesary to use the 64-bit version of `kmcomp`. If you install `wine` via homebrew, both a 32-bit and 64-bit version of `wine` is available, but the 32-bit version is only compatible with pre-Catalina versions of MacOS.

Download [KMComp](https://keyman.com/developer/download) and move `kmcomp.x64.exe` and `kmcmpdll.x64.dll` into `~/bin/keyman/`.

Since `kmcomp.x64.exe` is not native MacOS applications and were not installed from the Appstore, it will be necessary to grant `kmcomp.x64.exe` execution permissions.

Open the __*General tab*__ in __*Security & Privacy*__ in __*System Preferences*__. 

You will need to click on the lock symbol in the panel to make changes to settings.

Run the command:

```sh
$ wine64 ~/bin/keyman/kmcomp.x64.exe
```

This will generate an alert dialog indicating the application cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified. Click __Cancel__, and go to the __*Security & Privacy*__ panel. A message will now be visible on the __*General tab*__: _"kmcomp.x64.exe" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer_. Click on the __Allow Anyway__ button next to the warning message in the panel.

You may also need to authorise `kmcmpdll.x64.dll`.

In `~/.zshrc` define an alias:

```
alias kmcomp="wine64 ~/bin/keyman/kmcomp.x64.exe -w"
```

Reload `.zshrc` in current terminal session:

```sh
$ source ~/.zshrc
```
