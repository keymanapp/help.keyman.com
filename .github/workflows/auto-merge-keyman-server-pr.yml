#
# Automatically merges pull requests opened by keyman-server
# The initial use of this action is to upload product help documentation
# with resources/build/help-keyman-com.sh.
# That script creates a PR and then this workflow will be
# triggered to merge the PR once approved by the
# auto-approve-keyman-server-pr.yml script.
