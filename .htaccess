# versioning: these rules automatically redirect /foo/current-version to the
# newest version of the documentation under /foo, e.g. 13.0, /foo/13.0, and fall
# back to previous versions if no newer version is available. When we release a
# new version, we need to add in the rule for that version. 10.0 is the oldest
# version which falls under this pattern.
#
# The current-version:\d+.\d+ tag is used by the versioning script to get the
# current version (we can't simply use the newest because there may be alpha
# content on the site).
#
# When we add in the new version rule, remove the current- prefix from the
# older version. There are 3 places to insert the version number into the rule.
