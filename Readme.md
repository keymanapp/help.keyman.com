## How to run help.keyman.com locally with Apache on Docker

Previously, the site was run in IIS, but is now migrated to Apache. The Docker image is configured to host the site that can be accessed at http://localhost:8055.


### Pre-requisites

On the host machine, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/):

On Windows, Docker will also need either:
* hyper-v or
* [WSL2](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview)

### Builder actions

#### Stop the Docker container
1. Run `./build.sh stop`

#### Build the Docker image
1. Run `./build.sh build`.

#### Start the Docker container
1. Run `./build.sh start`.

#### Configure
Move PHP dependencies in Docker image from /var/www/vendor/ to /var/www/html/vendor
1. Run `./build.sh configure`.

After this, you can access the help.keyman site at http://localhost:8055

#### Remove the Docker container and image
1. Run `./build.sh clean`.

#### Running tests
Checks for broken links
1. Run `./build.sh test`


## How to run help.keyman.com locally with Docker Desktop's Kubernetes singlenode cluster

For testing Kubernetes deployment there are yaml files under `resources/kubectl`, that cover local developer testing. 

### Pre-requisites
On the host machine, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), then enable Kubernetes in the settings. Ensure you have built a help-keyman-app Docker image, and either tag it `docker.dallas.languagetechnology.org/keyman/help-keyman-app` or modify the `app-php` containers `image:` value to match you local copy's name.

### Deploying to a desktop cluster
To deploy the dev version to the cluster do the following:
1. Ensure your `kubectl` context is set to `docker-desktop`, though the Docker Desktop systray icon or by running:  
```bash
$> kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
```
2. Create a keyman namespace if it does not already exist:
```bash
$> kubectl create ns keyman
```
3. Apply the configs for the resources and start the pod:
```bash
$> kubectl --namespace keyman apply \
       -f resources/kubectl/help-kubectl-dev.yaml \
       -f resources/kubectl/help-kubectl.yaml
```
### Testing the site and `/api/deploy` webhook endpoint
The site can be reached on http://localhost:30080/ via web browser, and the deploy api is on http://localhost:30900/api/deploy, and can be activated like so:
```bash
$> curl -v --request POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=49af8531106a369bfee369f91dadec597e8ea3992ec2802bbe655be0ece17f15" \
    --data '{"action":"push","ref":"refs/heads/staging"}' \
    http://localhost:30900/api/deploy
```
This simulates enough of a GitHub webhook push event to pass validation on the responder.

### Clean up after testing

To remove the k8s deployment and resources, and delete everything do:
```bash
$> kubectl --namespace=keyman delete {svc,deploy,cm,secret,pvc}/help-keyman-com
```
Or just restart the deployment for further testing
```bash
$> kubectl --namespace=keyman rollout restart deploy/help-keyman-com
```
