4.  Select a default hotkey or click Custom and type the hotkey you wish
    to use.

    <div class="note">

    If you press a single letter or Shift plus a single letter, the
    hotkey will default to Ctrl + Alt plus the letter you pressed, in
    order to avoid conflicts with standard keyboard input.

    </div>

    <div class="note">

    To clear a hotkey that has been set previously, click Clear Hotkey
    or press Backspace.

    </div>

    <div class="note">

    Be aware that you can set the hotkey to replace common Windows
    hotkeys (Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V, etc).

    </div>

5.  Click OK to save your selection.

6.  Click OK again from the Configuration window to apply the changes.

The new hotkey will now be available.
