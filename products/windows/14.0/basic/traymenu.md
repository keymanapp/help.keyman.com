If you cannot find the Keyman icon for the Keyman menu, it may be in the
hidden notifications area of the Windows Taskbar. Check for the Keyman
icon by clicking the arrow or triangle next to the Windows clock.

If the Keyman icon is in the hidden notifications area, you should move
the Keyman icon permanently to the Windows Taskbar. Here's how to move
the icon:

-   On Windows 7:

    1.  Open the Windows Start menu.

    2.  In the search field, type and enter: Notification Area Icons

    3.  From the dropdown menu beside SIL International Keyman Engine
        x86, select 'Show icon and notifications'.

    4.  Click OK to apply changes. The Keyman icon will now always
        appear in the Windows Taskbar near the clock, if Keyman is on.

-   On Windows 8 and above:

    1.  Right-click on the Windows Taskbar.

    5.  Click OK to apply changes. The Keyman icon will now always
        appear in the Windows Taskbar near the clock, if Keyman is on.

    6.  Continue on to [Step 5](#tutorial_step5) of this guide.

If the Keyman icon is not in the hidden notifications area and not on
the Windows Taskbar near the clock, make sure Keyman has been started.
If you still cannot locate the Keyman icon and menu, visit the [SIL
Keyman Community](https://community.software.sil.org/c/keyman) for
