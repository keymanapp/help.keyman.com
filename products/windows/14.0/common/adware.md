# Does Keyman include adware or spyware?

No!

We never have and never will include adware or spyware components.
Keyman does contact the keyman.com website periodically to check for
updates for both Keyman and the keyboards you have installed. In this
process, the only information communicated is the current version of
Keyman and the version of the keyboards. You can switch this option off
in Keyman Configuration.
