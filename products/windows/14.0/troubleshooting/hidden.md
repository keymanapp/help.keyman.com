# How To - Fix A Problem with an Active Keyman Keyboard Not Typing

**Symptoms**

You may experience an issue in Windows 7 where:

-   Keyman is on; and
-   your Keyman keyboard is active, with its icon showing in the Keyman
    menu; but
-   your Keyman keyboard does not work.

**Resolution**

Unhide the Keyman menu as described in [Step 2](#tutorial_step2) of the
Getting Started tutorial.

This can also be resolved by switching language using the Windows
Language Bar or the Language Icon

**Background**

When the Keyman icon is in the hidden notification area of the Windows
taskbar, opening the notification area and selecting the icon causes it
to change the keyboard for the taskbar, not for your active application.
Clicking back to the active application results in the keyboard turning
off again.
