|------------|---------- |
| Message    | Version number '&lt;param&gt;' must be a semantic version format string with 'major\.minor\.patch' components\. |
| Module     | [kmc-ldml.LdmlCompilerMessages](kmc-ldml.ldmlcompilermessages) |
| Identifier | `ERROR_InvalidVersion` |

The version number in the LDML keyboard file must be a [semantic
version](https://semver.org) (semver) string. This string has a format of three
integers representing major, minor, and patch versions, separated by periods. In
the LDML keyboard specification, the full semver format is permitted, including
pre-release suffix strings, but the Keyman toolchain currently restricts the
format to the three integer components.

Example: `"1.12.3"`
