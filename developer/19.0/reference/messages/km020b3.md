title: KM020B3: ERROR_TextBeforeOrAfterNulInOutput
---

|            |           |
|------------|---------- |
| Message    | A rule with a nul statement in the output cannot also output text or text\-emitting statements |
| Module     | [kmc-kmn.KmnCompilerMessages](kmc-kmn.kmncompilermessages) |
| Identifier | `ERROR_TextBeforeOrAfterNulInOutput` |

If a rule has [`nul`](https://help.keyman.com/developer/language/reference/nul)
in the output, it means that it deletes any context referenced on the left-hand
side of the rule, and has no other output, so it does not make sense to have any
content apart from the `nul` statement in the output.

The following statements can still be used with `nul` in the output:
* [`beep()`](https://help.keyman.com/developer/language/reference/beep)
* [`call()`](https://help.keyman.com/developer/language/reference/call)
* [`reset()`](https://help.keyman.com/developer/language/reference/reset)
* [`return`](https://help.keyman.com/developer/language/reference/return)
* [`save()`](https://help.keyman.com/developer/language/reference/save)
* [`set()`](https://help.keyman.com/developer/language/reference/set)
* [`use()`](https://help.keyman.com/developer/language/reference/use)
