title:  Assigning an open source license
---
  
When you share your lexical model with the world, you will need to
assign a specific [open source
license](https://opensource.org/licenses). There are
hundreds of prewritten licenses, but for lexical models to be included
in this repository, you must use the MIT license:

MIT license
:   A permissive license that is short and to the point. It lets people
    do anything with your code with proper attribution and without
    warranty.

The MIT license is explored in detail at
[choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/),
from which the description above was taken.
