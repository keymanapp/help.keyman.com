title: Guide for Lexical Model Submissions
---
  
This is a guide for submitting lexical models to the lexical-models
repository. Lexical model developers will need to be proficient enough
with Git to keep their own fork in sync with the upstream branch. Though
this can be daunting, there are many other online resources for new
users to Git.

**Note:** This guide is written for lexical model developers using
Windows, so other OS users need to adjust paths accordingly.
