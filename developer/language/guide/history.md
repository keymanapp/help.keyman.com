title: Keyman language history

## Keyman 3

*   The structure of rules is not backwardly compatible with earlier versions of
    Keyman. The left hand side of the rule changed from being a sequence of
    keystrokes to being a context + single keystroke.
*   [Stores](stores) were introduced.
*   [Long line](long-lines) support

## Keyman 4

*   The `+` character became required, and usage became stricter to follow the
    standard now: the plus character must separate context from keystroke in a
    rule.
*   Keyboards are now compiled by the developer into .kmx files, rather than
    being distributed as .kmn files.

## Keyman 5

*   Added [Unicode support](unicode)
*   Added [Input Method eXtension support](../reference/call)
*   Deprecated [`bitmaps` statement](../reference/bitmap)

    10.0, in particular using multiple deadkeys in a row.

## Keyman 11
