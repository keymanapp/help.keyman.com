title: KeymanWeb Versioning
---

As of version 10.0, all platform editions of Keyman have aligned to the same versioning scheme. This allows us to simplify checks for feature support. However, for earlier releases, you should use the following lookup table:


| KeymanWeb Version | Keyman Desktop Version |
| --- | --- |
| 10.0 | 10.0 |
| 2.0 | 9.0 |
| 1.0 | 7.0 |

When passing in version parameters to cloud API functionality, ensure you use the Keyman Desktop versioning scheme, not the KeymanWeb versioning scheme, as this reflects the keyboard layout version requirements more closely.
