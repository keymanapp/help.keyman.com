---

LDML is the Locale Data Markup Language. It it an XML-based format specified as
the Unicode Consortiumâ€™s specification [UTS#35 Part 7], maintained by the
[Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR)][CLDR] Technical Commitee.

Like the [Keyman Keyboard Language (.kmn) format][kmn], the LDML Keyboard format
defines how keystrokes are interpreted and how keys are laid out in a virtual
keyboard. The LDML format has been defined from the beginning to become a
cross-platform industry standard, with active participation from several Unicode
member organizations including SIL Global.
