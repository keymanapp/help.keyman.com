title: Choosing a locale
---

As part of your keyboard development, you must choose one or more [BCP 47] locale codes to
associate with the keyboard.

The primary locale id is stored in the `locale` attribute of the [`keyboard3`][keyboard3]
(outer) element, while any additional locale ids are stored in the optional [`locales`][locales]
element.

[BCP 47]: ../../current-version/reference/bcp-47
[keyboard3]: ../reference/keyboard3
[locales]: ../reference/locales
