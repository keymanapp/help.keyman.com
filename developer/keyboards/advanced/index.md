title: Advanced Guide for Keyboard Submissions
---
  
This is an advanced guide for keyboard maintainers who will be
submitting pull requests to the full keyboards repository. Users will
need to be proficient enough with Git to keep their own fork in sync
with the upstream branch. If that sounds intimidating, maybe consider
using the Starter guide instead.

**Note:** This guide is written for Windows users, so other OS users
need to adjust paths accordingly.

[Step 1: Setup - One Time Only](step-1)

[Step 2: Before Starting Work on a Keyboard](step-2)

[Step 3: Development Tools and Building the Keyboard](step-3)

[Step 4: Organizing the Keyboard Files](step-4)

[Step 5: Submitting a GitHub Pull Request](step-5)
