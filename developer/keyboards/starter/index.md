**Note:** This guide is deprecated. Consider using the [GitHub Keyboard
Submission Guide](../github) instead.

This Starting guide is intended for keyboard developers who are
submitting only one or two keyboards. If you are a relatively new Git
user, this is the guide for you. The Advanced guide provides separate
instructions for deeper involvement in submitting, improving, and
reviewing keyboards.

**Note:** This guide is written for Windows users, so other OS users
need to adjust paths accordingly.

[Step 1: Get the Source](step-1)

[Step 2: Development Tools and Building the Keyboard](step-2)

[Step 3: Organizing the Keyboard Files](step-3)

[Step 4: Principles for Contributing Keyboards](step-4)

[Step 5: Submitting a GitHub Pull Request](step-5)
