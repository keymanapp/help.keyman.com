<h1>Step 4: Filling in package details</h1>

  <dt>Package Name</dt>

  <dd>
    <p>The Package Name will be displayed in the package install dialog, and within Keyman Desktop Configuration, wherever the
    package is referred to.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Readme File</dt>

  <dd>
    <p>Select the readme file from the list of files you added in the previous step. Remember that it should be a HTML file for
    optimum clarity.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Version</dt>

  <dd>
    <p>A version number for the package is important - it helps the your users know that they are using the most recent update of
    your package. The version format you should use is <code class='language-none'>1.0</code>. When making a major change to your package or keyboards in your
    package, increment the first part and set the second part to, e.g. <code class='language-none'>2.0</code>; when making a bug fix or a minor update,
    increment the second part, e.g. <code class='language-none'>1.1</code>.</p>

    <p>Version numbers should be in the form <code class='language-none'>major.minor[.subversion]</code>. Subversion is optional but is helpful for small bug fix
    releases. Each of the sections of the version should be an integer. Keyman Desktop does integer comparisons on the version
    numbers, so, for example, version <code class='language-none'>2.01</code> is regarded as older than version <code class='language-none'>2.2</code>. Alphabetic
    or date formats should be avoided as the installer for the keyboard cannot determine which version is older reliably.</p>
