<h1>Making a touchscreen keyboard</h1>
<h2>Setting up your Keyman project </h2>
<p>This is a useful convention for keeping track of your files:
<ol>
<li>Create a folder on your hard drive for all your Keyman developer files
<li>In that folder, create a folder for this project, named after the 
language. Use all lowercase letters for compatibility with other platforms.
<li>Now create a project in Keyman Developer with the same name as the new 
folder, and save it inside the new folder
</ol>
<p>Now you will be able to use this project to organize and create any files 
for desktop, mobile, web or other. It also facilitates uploading the files to 

the Keyman website later on.</p>

<h2>Add touch to an existing keyboard or create a new keyboard?</h2>

<p>
You
can add a mobile touchscreen keyboard to an existing desktop keyboard, or
you can create a new touchscreen keyboard from scratch. You should be aware 
that there will be cross-over between mobile and desktop keyboards. (In 
Keyman 
terms, "desktop" includes laptop computers or any device with a physical 
keyboard). Your mobile device can have an external keyboard, which will use 

the desktop Keyman keyboard. So the Keyman strategy is to always bundle touch 

keyboards with desktop keyboards to make them work on multiple platforms.</p>


<p>If creating
from scratch, you click the New icon in the Keyman Developer toolbar
(or select File &gt; New from the menu), and specify the file name
for your keyboard. We recommend a name using only lowercase letters,
numbers and underscore. I&rsquo;ll choose &ldquo;mobile_fulfulde.kmn&rsquo;
.
</p>

<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_1.png')?>"  width=
"371" height="368" alt="choose new file type"/></p>
<h2>Adding the required metadata</h2>

<p>After
creating the file, Keyman Developer will ask you to name the
keyboard. This name can include spaces and upper case letters if
desired. I&rsquo;ll name this one &ldquo;Fulfulde for Mobile&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_2.png')?>" alt=
"keyboard metadata"  width="486" height="281" /></p>

<p>The
first thing you need to do is to tell Keyman Developer this keyboard
will include some kind of mobile device. &nbsp;You do this in the
Targets list just below the keyboard name. I&rsquo;ll select &ldquo;mobile
&rdquo;
in the list, (towards the end). You see in the picture above that
Keyman Developer checked the &ldquo;windows&rdquo; box by default, I
can uncheck that or leave it checked if I am going to add a Windows
keyboard to this set. </p>
<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_3.png')?>" alt=
"mobile target" /></p>

<p>This
will include all mobile devices, both Android and iOS, both phones
and tablets. It is possible if needed to select Android only or iOS
only if needed, and to develop a different keyboard layout for
tablets than for phones, but for this example, with only a few
characters needed to be added to the default keyboards, there is no
need for that kind of complexity. 
</p>

<p> 
(If
you are adding a mobile layout to an existing keyboard file, you
would open that file in Keyman Developer, go to the Targets box and
check &ldquo;mobile&rdquo; or whatever mobile targets you wanted to
specify, then follow along from here). </p>

<h2>Adding the touch optimized feature</h2>
<p>The
next step is to add the touch-optimised feature to our keyboard
setup. If you scroll to the bottom of the details tab, there is the
list of features to add. I&rsquo;ll click the Add button and choose
&ldquo;touch optimised keyboard.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_4.png')?>" alt=
"touch-optimised"  width="624" height="340" /></p>

<p>
Keyman
developer asks me to choose one of three templates for the mobile
layout.</p>
<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_5.png')?>" alt=
"three templates"  width="229" height="274" /></p>

<p>
The
&ldquo;template-latin&rdquo; layout includes many accented
characters, like the default keyboards for Android and iOS do. The
&ldquo;template-basic&rdquo; layout has no extra characters, and the
template-traditional has a few extra characters (mostly punctuation
symbols if you long-press period or full stop). For this example,
I&rsquo;ll choose &ldquo;template-basic&rdquo; because accented
characters are not needed for Fulfulde. But if I knew that many
eventual users might want to be able to type French or other European
languages as well as Fulfulde, and wouldn&rsquo;t like to have to
switch the keyboard to do so, I could choose &ldquo;template-latin&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
<h2> Defining one or several touch layouts</h2>
I
select the template and click OK. Keyman Developer now adds a new tab
in the left column, the Touch Layout tab. 
</p>
<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_6.png')?>" alt=
"touch layout"  width="624" height="473" /></p>
<p>
That
is where we need to go now to add characters to our touch layout. But
before doing that, there is one important thing to take note of in
the touch layout. By default, Keyman Developer has created a layout
for phones and another layout for tablets. They all start out the
same, but as I add characters, I will have to make sure I add all the
characters to both layouts, or I&rsquo;ll discover that my keyboard
does not work for all device sizes. 
</p>
<p>
In
the image, you see in the Platform box that Keyman Developer is currently showing the
tablet layout. This box  is
where I&rsquo;d choose which layout I&rsquo;d design in.</p>


<p>
But
I&rsquo;m going to make this keyboard simple, and just have one
layout for both tablets and phones. So in the platform box, I am
going to click the &ldquo;minus&rdquo; button, &nbsp;to delete the tablet
layout. When there is only one mobile layout, Keyman Developer will
compile that layout for all mobile devices. (I could also have chosen
to delete the phone layout and done my layout design in the tablet
layout). </p>
<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_7.png')?>" alt=
"platform list"  width="265" height="179" /></p>

<h2>Adding longpress characters</h2>
<p>Now
I can start adding characters. I&rsquo;ll click on the &ldquo;y&rdquo;
key in the layout, then I&rsquo;ll look at the  &ldquo;longpress
keys&rdquo; area at the lower left. </p>
<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_8.png')?>" alt=
"add longpress"  width="624" height="252" /></p>
<p>I
click the plus button , and Keyman Developer adds a new key in the  longpress area .</p>
<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_9.png')?>" alt=
"longpress added"  width="624" height="252" /></p>
<p>I'm going to use this key for the y with hook. I click inside it to make  it active, then I&rsquo;ll go look
for my y with hook character in the character map to the right. If I
type &ldquo;y hook&rdquo; in the search box, Keyman Developer shows
the character I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_10.png')?>" alt=
"adding keycap"  width="624" height="256" /></p>
<p>If
I double click on the lower case y with hook, that copies the character
to the keycap box of my new key. (I could also click and drag the character from the character map to the key).
</p>
<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_11.png')?>" alt=
"keycap added"  width="624" height="272" /></p>
<h2>New key info</h2>
<p>
There are several important pieces of information that got copied over. 
If we look at the properties of the new key to the right, we see that 
this new key has the &ldquo;text&rdquo; Æ´ (what appears on the keycap),the &ldquo;Unicode 
value&rdquo; U+01B4 and the &ldquo;ID&rdquo; U_01B4. All of these
were copied from the character map. 
NOTE: If you copy one character from the character map to a new key, then realize you copied the wrong character, 
dragging a second  character may not replace all the needed information into the key. If a key has a character in it already,  it works better to hold CTRL  as you drag the new character into it.
<p>
I could add the other three characters; hook b,  hook d, and eng, as longpress characters as well. I could  select the regular letter I want to longpress, click plus in the longpress keys area and copy the needed character. Here for example is the b with hook:
<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_12.png')?>" alt=
"keycode added"  width="624" height="125" /></p> 
<p>After I have added my four lowercase characters as longpress keys, the keyboard looks like this.  Even when I don't have that letter selected, I can see which keys have longpress keys by the dot beside the letter.
<img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_12-2.png')?>" alt=
"layout with longpress added"  width="1242" height="404" /></p>
<a href=
"../../../../language/guide/virtual-keys#toc-virtual-keys-and-touch-layouts">

See the Keyman Language guide on virtual keys</a>
<h2>Adding uppercase characters</h2>
I could do two different things for the upper case letters. I could add them as longpress keys beside their lowercase equivalents, by  pressing the plus key again to add a second longpress character to each letter. 
This would mean users would not have to press Shift to be able to type the upper case hook y. But since a user needs to press Shift for all the regular Latin upper case letters, it might make more sense to put the uppercase letters into the Shift layer. 
<p>
I can  change to the shift layer by finding the layer box at lower left, and choosing &lsquo;shift&rsquo;instead of &lsquo;default.&rsquo; 
<img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_13.png')?>" alt=
"changing to shift layer"  width="188" height="97" /></p>
Now I see the upper case letters on the keyboard, and I can add longpress characters  to these in the same way I did on the default layer. I click the letter, then click &lsquo;+&rsquo; to add a key, then copy the character info from the character map. Adding my upper case y hook to Y would look like this:

<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_14.png')?>" alt=
"new key added to row"  width="188" height="97" /></p>

<h2> Compiling your keyboard</h2>
<p>Now
click Save to save your work, and compile the keyboard. (Keyboard &gt;
Compile Keyboard, or press F7). Hopefully you&rsquo;ll see it
compiled with no error messages:</p>
<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_20.png')?>" alt=
"successful compile"  width="624" height="87" /></p>
If you do see error messages, you can search  for them in the Keyman developer documentation. 
<h1>Testing your keyboard</h1>
<p>Other Keyman help pages describe how 
you can test your keyboard:
<ul><li> <a href=
"../../test/keyboard-touch-mobile-emulator">
  On a virtual device in the Chrome web browser on your computer</a></li>
<li><a href=
"../../test/keyboard-touch-and-desktop">
  On your own device accessing the keyboard over the network
</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If your device cannot connect to your computer on the local network (for 
instance if your computer is on a wired office network and your device is on 
the wireless office network), the above technique for sharing may not work.
You can put your keyboard in a package and share it over the Internet with
your device, as described below.</p>
<h1>Packaging and distributing your keyboard</h1>
<p>Another Keyman help file describes <a href="../../distribute/tutorial">how 
to build a package file.</a></p>
<h2>BCP 47 tags for Fulfulde</h2>
<p></p>
<p><a href="../../distribute/tutorial/step-3.php">Step 3</a> of the package 

building tutorial describes adding the BCP 47 language tag to your package.


When I came to the step of adding a tag for Fulfulde, I had to do some 
research. I naively thought "Fulfulde" was a clear enough label for the 
language. It is not, since it is a language chain rather than one language. 

The BCP 47 tag in many cases is the same as the <a href=
"https://www.ethnologue.com">SIL Ethnologue code</a>, so that is where I had 

to go to find the tags I needed. In the end I added four tags for four
Fulfulde languages:</p>
<p><img src="<?= cdn('img/developer/100/simpleTouchKeyboard_36.png')?>" alt=
"BCP 47 tags"   /></p>
<p>I also added the script designator <code class='language-none'>Latn</code> 
for Latin script. This is recommended for Windows, which sometimes fails to 

install the desktop keyboard if there is not a script designator on the BCP
47 
tag. We recommend that you always put in the script tag unless there is a 
specific reason not to.</p>
<p>Some languages have only two letters in their BCP 47 tag. For instance, the 
Hausa language has an Ethnologue code <code class='language-none'>hau</code> 

but the BCP 47 tag is <code class='language-none'>ha</code>. Keyman Developer

knows about this, and will change the tag to <code>ha</code> if I put in the

Ethnologue tag.</p>
<h1>Next steps</h1>
<p>The two following articles on Amharic describe a more complex touchscreen 
example where quite frequently two keys are pressed to get one distinct 
character. (Amharic is a Abugida or syllabary script, where one character can 

represent a consonant and following vowel).
